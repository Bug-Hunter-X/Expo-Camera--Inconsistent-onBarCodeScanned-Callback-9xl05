This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` function may not be called consistently, or at all, depending on the circumstances. This can lead to the app not recognizing barcodes or QR codes, which is a critical functionality of the app.

```javascript
<Camera type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} onBarCodeScanned={this.handleBarCodeScanned} style={styles.camera}>
</Camera>

const handleBarCodeScanned = ({ type, data }) => {
  console.log('Barcode scanned:', type, data);
  // Handle barcode data
};
```
