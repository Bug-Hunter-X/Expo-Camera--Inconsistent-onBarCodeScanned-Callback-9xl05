This solution attempts to improve the consistency of the `onBarCodeScanned` callback by adding a timeout to ensure the camera has enough time to process the scanned barcode and trigger the event. This is not a guaranteed fix, but a work around for the inconsistency. 

```javascript
<Camera type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} onBarCodeScanned={this.handleBarCodeScanned} style={styles.camera}>
</Camera>

const handleBarCodeScanned = ({ type, data }) => {
  clearTimeout(this.barcodeTimeout);
  this.barcodeTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Barcode scanned:', type, data);
    // Handle barcode data
  }, 500); // Adjust timeout as needed
};
```
